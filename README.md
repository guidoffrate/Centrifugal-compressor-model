# Centrifugal-compressor-model
This is a 1-D Matlab model of a centrifugal compressor (impeller + vaneless diffuser) that simulates the compressor performance given the machine's geometrical specifications.
The model is thought explicitly to allow you to:
- optimize the compressor geometry to maximize the total-to-static isentropic efficiency given a prescribed total-to-static pressure ratio (single objective optimization);\
- optimize the compressor geometry to simultaneously maximize the total-to-static isentropic efficiency and the total-to-static pressure ratio (multi-objective optimization);\
- generate the machine performance maps by simulating off-design operation once the geometry is fixed;
